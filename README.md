## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Next.js
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind
- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) - Auth.js
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Prisma
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Zod

### What I learned

Setting up a credential email/password login for authentication and authorization using Auth.js

Concepts for handling db work with a boomkarking system for a user account and how to check for and display the users bookmarks.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to see how others handled the bookmarking system for something that might be more efficient. Also diving into Auth.js more since I really only know the basics and scratched the surface with this project.
